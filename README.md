# LinearSearchJava

n = the length of the array

Performance
Best Case = O(1) 
As, if the element to be found is already on the first index of the array

Average Case = O(n/2) = O(n)
Suppose that the element could be on the (n/2)th position of the array

Worst Case = O(n)
As, the element can be on the last index of the array.
